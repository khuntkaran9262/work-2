        <P style="font-size:19px;"><b>India's medical and public health services have improved dramatically since
                independence. As a result, average life expectancy at birth has risen by more than 25 years since World
                War II, although it still lags behind expectancies in the world’s more affluent societies.
                <br>
                <br>
                While death from starvation has become rare, malnutrition has remained widespread. Much of the
                population lacks access to safe drinking water, seasonally if not year-round. Dysentery and other
                diseases caused by waterborne organisms are major killers, especially of children. Poorly treated and
                improperly disposed sewage pose serious health problems. Most diseases endemic to tropical regions are
                significant causes of morbidity in India. The rate of tuberculosis is high, and the incidence of
                blindness, mainly caused by trachoma, is even higher. Great strides, however, have been made in
                combating certain diseases. Smallpox, once a leading cause of death, was declared eradicated in 1977.
                The vigorous National Malaria Eradication Programme, launched in 1958, almost succeeded in ridding India
                of this once very common disease, but the development of resistance to DDT among mosquitoes caused a
                resurgence of the problem. This led to renewed public health efforts and, subsequently, to a slow but
                steady decline in the number of affected individuals. AIDS and HIV infection have increased; although
                the overall proportion of the population affected is quite tiny, the number of people infected is one of
                the highest for any country in the world.</b></P>
